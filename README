DESCRIPTION: An Api that uses node.js, express, and mongo to store users and 
information sent through post requests. When root is loaded a page containing
all the data in html is returned. Users can also use methods to retreive 
their latest info.
IMPLEMENTATION: 

The POST /sendLocation method receives a login, latitude, longitude, and 
message. If the login is one of a list of valid logins then the parameters 
are all inserted into a mongodb collection named checkins. If any of the 
parameters are missing or the login is not valid then an error message is 
returned.

The GET /latest.json method recieves a login. The checkins collection is 
searched for all documents with that login name and outputs a sorted list 
of these documents. The first item of the list is sent back as a response.
 If the login is not found or no login is sent then empty json data is sent
  back as a response.

The GET / method retrieves all the documents from the mongodb checkins 
collection in sorted order and then parses the json data into a readable 
string. the readable string is added to an html doc as a <p> (paragraph) 
tag and then the final html doc is served as response text. 

TIME SPENT: 10 hours
